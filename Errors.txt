1. Overlapping holes makes uncorrect processes (Overlapping holes should unite into one bigger hole)
2. Adding addjecent holes create process of size zero (shouldn't create a proceses between two consecutive holes)
3. Adding hole with a position outside the memory size created a strange process outside the memory
4. Handle negative sign inputs (there should be no starting point nor size with a negative sign accepted)
5. Algorithms should place all the segments of the process or non of them (currently it store the process name as a key even if the process couldn't be added to the memory)
6. An error where no process added using any of the algorithms when the user didn't enter holes (May be you can add a trivial hole with zero size if the list instead of being completely empty)
7. Make sure that no process will exist outside the memory size
8. adding a single hole at the middle creates only 1 process beneath it (it should split the memory into two old process)
9. Removing process isn't working

VERY IMP NOTE: I believe the reason for many of these errors is that you use the the holes list to add process but you then don't update this holes list.
